organoid_analysis.R

  Purpose:
     This R script was created to analyze neural organoid data in preparation
     for the analysis of our own lab-created neural organoids. The script
     utilizes the Seurat package and various other libraries for data processing
     and analysis. It first sets up directories for storing output files. The
     data is read from a file, and essential preprocessing steps such as finding
     variable features, scaling, and normalization are performed. The script
     then filters out genes related to mitochondrial and ribosomal functions.
     Clustering analysis is conducted at different resolutions, and UMAP plots
     are generated for visualization. Marker genes are identified for each
     cluster, and gene expression heatmaps are created. The average expression
     for each cell type is calculated and visualized through a heatmap.
     Enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) is performed to identify enriched gene sets
     in each cell type. Various visualizations, including DimPlot, ridge plots,
     and violin plots, are generated to explore the clustering and gene
     expression patterns in the neural organoid data. The ultimate goal of this
     analysis is to gain insights into the cellular diversity and gene
     expression patterns within the neural organoids, which will aid in our own
     lab's research and analysis of the lab-created neural organoids.

embryoid_analysis.R

  Purpose:

    This R script was developed to facilitate our lab's research on embryoids
    and enable the processing and analysis of embryoid data using R. By loading
    essential libraries and setting up the base directory, the code efficiently
    reads in the raw data matrix, barcodes, and gene names from specified files.
    It then preprocesses the data, creating a Seurat object, finding variable
    features, and performing PCA for dimensionality reduction. The subsequent
    UMAP visualization and clustering steps help explore the diverse cell
    populations and gene expression patterns within the embryoid samples.
    Additionally, the code assesses mitochondrial DNA content and generates
    various informative visualizations, such as feature plots and violin plots.
    The enrichment analysis further allows the identification of gene sets
    associated with specific cell clusters, providing crucial insights into
    early embryonic development. Overall, this concise and powerful analysis
    pipeline empowers our lab to work with embryoids and efficiently process and
    analyze embryoid data using R, contributing to advancing our understanding
    of this complex model system.

  TODO:
    - Go back to paper and distinguish Matrigel v. other in control group, 
      get metadata labeling for that in RDS.
    - From extracted markers, determine which cells belong to which of the three
      germ layers.
    - Investigate expression of cerebellar malformation gene set in each germ
      layer. Is there gene set enrichement in a specific germ layer? Need to
      confirm which progenitor lineage is of greatest interest. Determine if
      results are what we expect.
