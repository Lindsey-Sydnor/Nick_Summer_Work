Touchups of Nick scripts. Made executable.

determine_thresholds.R

  Purpose:
    We had some different data files on the server for the organoid data -- each
    at different stages of processing. We lost some information on preprocessing
    thresholds, and needed to compare RDS's to recapitulate preprocessing /
    flush out our analysis script.
